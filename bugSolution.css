To resolve this issue, it's recommended to avoid mixing percentage and pixel values directly within the `calc()` function. Instead, use percentages consistently, or if pixel values are required, ensure a consistent baseline.  This often means calculating the pixel value beforehand and using it as a fixed value.

Here's a potential solution:

```css
#container {
  width: 300px; /* Example container width */
}

#myElement {
  width: calc(50% - (300px * 0.1)); /* 10px is 10/300=3.33% of 300px */
}
```

Alternatively, if the container width is not fixed and you must use pixels, consider using a JavaScript solution to calculate the pixel value dynamically once the page renders and then setting the width of #myElement using JavaScript.
